# Angular Data Flows

This project shows simple demos of four possible data flows in Angular:

* Events: The standard way of data exchange between parent and child components.
* Function: A React-like implementation to hand over functions as properties.
* Signal: The new way of data exchange in Angular, like Solid.js.
* Observable: Asynchronous programming using RxJS in Angular.
